## US Inflation Over the Decades

Inflation, a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value
of money, is a complex and multifaceted economic phenomenon. It impacts
every segment of society, from consumers and businesses to policymakers
and investors. This exploration focuses on the fluctuations and patterns
of US inflation over the decades, tracing its roots, its implications,
and its broader economic significance.

## Economic Impacts and Broader Repercussions

Inflation doesn't just influence prices at the supermarket or the gas
station. It's a key indicator of economic health and carries
implications for monetary policy, interest rates, and overall economic
stability. High or hyperinflation can erode savings, distort spending
behavior, and create uncertainty, while deflation can signal a
contracting economy and lead to decreased consumer spending.
Understanding inflation's trajectory is crucial for predicting its
future implications and formulating responsive strategies.

## U.S. Inflation History and Key Monetary Changes

1.  [Early U.S. History (1776-1914)]{.underline}: U.S. inflation was
    largely influenced by wartime periods. The Gold Standard was in
    place, tying the dollar's value to gold. Wars like the Civil War and
    WWI led to temporary abandonments of this standard, resulting in
    inflationary spikes, notably a 20% rise in 1918. However, post-war
    periods and a return to the Gold Standard often brought about
    deflation and stabilization of prices.

2.  [Transition to Bretton Woods (1930s-1944):]{.underline} The Great
    Depression saw deflationary trends due to the monetary system's
    rigidity. By 1933, the U.S. completely left the Gold Standard. In
    1944, the Bretton Woods Agreement established the dollar as the main
    global reserve currency, pegged to gold.

3.  [1970's Changes:]{.underline} Concerns arose in the 1970s about
    gold's ability to cover the increasing U.S. dollar supply. Factors
    like military expenses caused money supply surpluses. In 1971,
    President Nixon abandoned Bretton Woods, introducing a floating
    exchange rate system. Subsequent oil shocks in the 1970s resulted in
    inflation rates exceeding 12% and later 13%.

4.  [Volcker's Approach (1979 Onwards):]{.underline} Paul Volcker,
    Federal Reserve Chair, implemented a new strategy in 1979. Instead
    of controlling inflation via interest rates, the focus shifted to
    controlling the money supply. This led to high interest rates,
    reaching 20% in 1980. However, by 1983, inflation fell below 4%, and
    the measures introduced during the Volcker era have helped maintain
    relatively stable inflation levels over the subsequent decades.

## U.S. Inflation: Today

As the U.S. economy reopens, consumer demand has strengthened.

Meanwhile, supply bottlenecks, from semiconductor chips to lumber, are
causing strains on automotive and tech industries. While this points
towards increasing inflation, some suggest that it may be temporary, as
prices were depressed in 2020.

At the same time, the Federal Reserve is following an "average inflation
targeting" regime, which means that if a previous inflation shortfall
occurred in the previous year, it would allow for higher inflationary
periods to make up for them. As the last decade has been characterized
by low inflation and low interest rates, any prolonged period of
inflation will likely have pronounced effects on investors and financial
markets.

Recently, national attention has shifted to the increases in inflation
which has been attributed to a number of factors such as the war in
Ukraine, supply chain disruptions, and monetary spending. Many of these
factors were a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government
stimulus packages.

Economist point to three main drivers of inflation, the first of which
is demand-pull inflation where it is theorized that excess consumer
demand leads to companies raising their prices and thus increasing
inflation. Next is cost-push inflation which says that when the cost for
raw and intermediate goods increases then that pushes companies to raise
their prices and pass the cost onto consumers. Finally, monetary policy
affects inflation where increases in the money supply reduce the value
of the dollar meaning consumers can buy less with the same amount of
money, effectively increasing prices and inflation.

## Literature Review:

Inflation has been a major subject of economic discourse for
decades.Numerous studies have also debated the cause-and-effect
relationship between inflation and employment, often referencing the
Phillips Curve. However, as economies evolve and face new challenges,
from technological advancements to global pandemics, the determinants
and repercussions of inflation become ever more complex.

The literature has broadly evolved from macroeconomic theories of the
past to more nuanced, data-driven analyses today. Yet, despite extensive
research, predicting inflation remains a complex endeavor due to its
multifaceted nature and global interdependencies.

1.  [Historical Monetary Perspectives:]{.underline} Beyond Friedman and
    Schwartz's seminal assertion that inflation is fundamentally a
    monetary phenomenon, earlier works by Irving Fisher (1911) in "The
    Purchasing Power of Money" presented the Quantity Theory of Money,
    postulating a direct relationship between the money supply and the
    overall price level.

2.  [Structuralist vs. Monetarist Views]{.underline}: The 1970s saw a
    divergence between structuralists and monetarists. While
    monetarists, led by figures like Milton Friedman, insisted on the
    primacy of money supply, structuralists argued for the role of other
    factors, like wage and price rigidities. The Latin American
    hyperinflations of the 1980s further intensified this debate, with
    authors such as Dornbusch and Edwards (1990) exploring the
    structural and external debt drivers of such inflationary episodes.

3.  [Globalization and Inflation:]{.underline} As economies became more
    intertwined, researchers like Rogoff (2003) began to examine how
    globalization impacts inflation. They found that increased trade and
    financial openness often put downward pressure on prices, given the
    competitive forces at play.

4.  [Behavioral Economics & Inflation Expectations:]{.underline}
    Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996) introduced behavioral elements,
    suggesting that people's inflation expectations could be sticky due
    to cognitive biases. Their work underscores that beyond raw economic
    factors, human psychology plays a crucial role in inflation
    dynamics.

5.  [The Role of Central Banks:]{.underline} Blinder (1998) has stressed
    the pivotal role of central banks in managing inflation
    expectations, advocating for transparency and credibility in
    monetary policy. This idea was further echoed by Taylor (1993) with
    the introduction of the Taylor rule, emphasizing the importance of
    systematic monetary policy in response to inflation and output
    fluctuations.

6.  [Inflation in a Post-Crisis World:]{.underline} Post the 2008
    financial crisis, discussions around inflation took a new turn.
    Authors like Ball and Mazumder (2011) explored the flattened
    Phillips Curve, observing weaker links between unemployment and
    inflation. In more recent times, with economic downturns triggered
    by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars have started
    probing the disinflationary effects of such demand shocks and their
    potential transition to longer-term inflationary pressures due to
    fiscal stimuli and supply chain disruptions.

In sum, while historical perspectives on inflation laid the groundwork
for our understanding, ongoing research continues to highlight its
multifaceted determinants, influenced by both domestic policy decisions
and global economic dynamics.
