# US Inflation Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of US inflation rates using advanced time-series modeling techniques. The primary goal is to forecast future inflation trends by leveraging historical data and various economic indicators.

## Key Features
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: The dataset includes historical US inflation rates along with relevant economic indicators. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed EDA to understand the data distribution, trends, and correlations between variables.
- Time-Series Modeling: Implementation of advanced time-series models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to forecast inflation rates.
- Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Impact of COVID-19: Analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflation trends, highlighting significant changes and anomalies during the pandemic period.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into the future trends of US inflation rates. The models demonstrate varying degrees of accuracy, with the Deep RNN model showing the most promise for capturing complex patterns in the data.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of time-series analysis and machine learning techniques in economic forecasting. The insights gained from this analysis can aid policymakers and economists in making informed decisions.
